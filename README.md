# notiondraw

A lightweight sketching webapp developed to be embedded in Notion

```cpp
/embed -> penguido.com
```

Supports mouse, pen (stylus) and touch input.

So far it has basic functionalities:

- Stroke width/color
- Pen/Eraser mode
- Undo/Redo
- Clear canvas
- Dark/Light mode
- Saves sketch for later editing or reference

Some ideas to be implemented:

- [ ]  Pen pressure support
- [ ]  Highlighting (and other pen modes)
- [ ]  Shapes
- [ ]  Image import and transformation
- [ ]  Optimize shape history (there is a stutter when starting to sketch)
